# 📊 Data Analytics Internship Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Internship** project repository! 🚀  
This repo includes 4 real-world tasks that showcase my data handling, visualization, and analysis skills using Python and key libraries like **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TextBlob, and WordCloud**.

---

## 🔥 Projects Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Objective:**  
Analyze book data to uncover price distributions, availability, and ratings.  

**Key Highlights:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed price data
- Found statistical insights (mean, median, min, max)
- Detected duplicates and missing values
- Converted star ratings from text to numbers
- Visualized price distributions, boxplots, and correlations

📈 *Tools Used:* `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

### ✅ Task 2: Data Documentation
**Objective:**  
Automatically generate a professional Word report summarizing EDA findings.

📝 *Tools Used:* `python-docx`

---

### ✅ Task 3: Data Visualization
**Objective:**  
Visualize insights to make them more human-readable and portfolio-ready.  

**Key Visuals:**
- Histograms & Boxplots
- Countplots of availability
- Price vs Rating analysis

🎨 *Tools Used:* `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

---

### ✅ Task 4: Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
**Objective:**  
Analyze public sentiment on book reviews.  

**Key Features:**
- Used TextBlob to classify reviews as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**
- Created a **word cloud** of frequent review terms
- Exported sentiment results to CSV

💬 *Tools Used:* `TextBlob`, `WordCloud`, `Pandas`
